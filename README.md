We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-app-service/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  #### Default App Service with NODE
```hcl
module "key_vault" {
  source                      = "clouddrove/app-service/azure"
  version                     = "1.0.0"
  enabled                     = true
  name                        = "app"
  environment                 = "test"
  label_order                 = ["name", "environment", ]
  resource_group_name         = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
  location                    = module.resource_group.resource_group_location

  service_plan = {
    kind = "Windows"
    size = "S1"
    tier = "Free"
  }

  app_service_name       = "test-app-service"
  enable_client_affinity = true
  enable_https           = true

  site_config = {
    use_32_bit_worker_process = true
    windows_fx_version        = "node|18-lts"
  }

  app_settings = {
    WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION = "~16"
  }
 }
  ```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
